                <p>Author Tracy Slater, an American writer and academic who fell in love with a Japanese man, married him, and now lives with him and their daughter in Japan, describes her journey in a new book,
                <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQS4CTW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1">"The Good Shufu: Finding Love, Life and Home on the Far Side of the World."</a> (<em>Shufu</em> means “housewife” in Japanese.)</p>
                <p>The book is a warts-and-all account of how Ms. Slater, 48, who had barely traveled outside the U.S. when she first visited Japan to teach business English, fell in love with an Osaka salaryman, adjusted to a new culture, made the tough decision to give up her life in Boston, and spent years helping to care for an ailing father-in-law and trying to have a child in her 40s.</p>
                <p>Ms. Slater chatted with WSJ Expat about the complications of being a western woman married to an Asian man, why she never really became fluent in Japanese, and how she struggled to keep her sense of self in Japan. An edited conversation follows.</p>

                <p><strong>You’re very honest about your mixed feelings about Japan. So, how is it now that you’ve lived there a while?</strong></p>
                <p>I still have mixed emotions about it. I feel, in some ways, the same as I did when I finished the book. In some ways, it’s more complicated because I have a daughter who is half-Japanese and is tied to Japan. But I wanted to be really honest in the book about my mixed feelings. We have a sort of romanticized image of expatriotism, and that it’s only a positive and exciting thing. Overall, Japan has been really positive for me, and it’s an interesting and fascinating and nuanced life. And yet it’s not home, and will never be home, and it’s not easy.</p>
                 <P><strong>You talk a good deal about how neither you nor your husband is fully comfortable in each other’s languages.</strong></p>
                <p>I do feel like neither of us is fluent in the other’s language. He is much closer to being fluent in English. I’m at a very basic conversation-in-Japanese ability. We do all our communication in English, although his syntax is reversed a lot of the time. And he sometimes has a hard time understanding other English speakers. We definitely cannot have the kind of intellectual discussion I had envisioned having.</p>
                <p><Strong>You’re very honest about those limitations.</Strong></p>
                <p>The experience has been a mixed bag. There were times when I have struggled with it. How did I end up in a marriage where I can’t really discuss politics or literary things? But at the same time, I feel like there are real unexpected benefits. I don’t expect he’s going to understand me all the time. I think in some ways, nobody understands their partner all the time, or even the majority of the time. And in one unexpected way, it’s really a boon. I don’t make it into anything other than a language thing when he doesn’t understand me. I’m a real analyzer, and in past relationships, that’s gotten me into trouble. Now I say, you know what? This is not his first language.</p>
                <p><Strong>How old is your daughter, and how is she doing?</Strong></p>
                <p>She’s 20-months-old – she’s a mite! I speak to her only in English and my husband only in Japanese. When we read her bedtime stories, he’ll read in Japanese and I read in English at the same time. So we’re really speaking to her in two languages at once. I thought maybe it would confuse her, but my husband convinced me she would be able to handle it. She understands both languages really well.</p>
                <p><Strong>So, apparently there’s a whole genre of books and stories about Asian men with western women.</Strong></p>
                <p>Yes – there’s a hashtag, #AMWF, Asian men, western females. I didn’t know about it until I published the book. It’s more popular among younger people who are still dating…One thing that’s interesting is that it’s so much more rare to see a western female with an Asian male. That’s not something that I ever thought of before Toru (her husband).</p>
                <p><Strong>What would you say was the main message of your book?</Strong></p>
                <p>I feel like it has a number of primary messages. One, I would say, is the thing that I most wanted to communicate to readers that I learned about living experiences: sometimes you can’t properly find yourself until you let yourself get lost in the first place. I had a firm plan, and was going to stick with it. But then I immersed myself in this world and found a much deeper sense of self by having let myself get lost. I ended up finding my equilibrium. To know that I could do that is extremely grounding.</p>
                <p><Strong>Would you say you have advice for other expats?</Strong></p>
                <p>You don’t have to love the country you’re in to have a worthwhile life. To me, that was a big “aha” moment in my experience. I kept waiting and asking, when am I going to fall in love with Japan? That was a mistake. That’s when I realized that you don’t have to love Japan as long as you are fascinated and always learning from it. That’s a life to be thankful for.</p>
                <p><Strong>How is your Japanese today?</Strong></p>
                <p>It’s been taking a back seat after my first pregnancy and miscarriage. I was having [fertility] treatments and going to the clinic almost every day. There was no way I had time or energy to study Japanese. It was also part of my initial reluctance: learning Japanese was not a life goal of mine. And I found, it’s a huge commitment to learn Japanese. My father-in-law was ill and that took an enormous amount of time. Then I got pregnant with [my daughter]. So even if I wanted to study more, I wouldn’t have had time for the past seven years. But one of the nice things about Japan is that it’s such an insular country, you’re always seen as an outsider, no matter what. And a lot of Japanese don’t expect you do speak Japanese.</p>
                <p><Strong>How long have you been in Japan?</Strong></p>
                <p>It’s coming up on 11 years.</p>
                <p><Strong>You talk in your book about culture shock, even in traveling back-and-forth for visits.</Strong></p>
                <p>There’s a re-entry phase for a couple of weeks, either in your home country or back in Japan. I don’t let myself assume that I have any wisdom in those times.</p>
                <p><Strong>You also warn expats about not romanticizing where they’re not living.</Strong></p>
                <p>I think that’s a danger in being human – you always romanticize the other path that we could have taken. I definitely catch myself thinking, if I were in the U.S., I would be doing this or that.</p>
