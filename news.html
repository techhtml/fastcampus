            <h1>Laos holiday guide: plan the perfect two-week trip</h1>
            <!-- 제목 : 부연설명 -->
            <p>Laos has so much to offer it can’t be ‘done’ in a fortnight, so focus on one region or cherry-pick from our list of its top sights, treks, homestays, tours and even the Most Secret Place on Earth</p>

            <p>andlocked, communist, studded with limestone spires and gilded temples, riddled with caves and home to rare wildlife, Laos has a unique charm for adventurous travellers. They relish its sleepy atmosphere, charming people and the sharp contrast with Thailand or Vietnam.</p>
            <p>If you don’t have the backpacker’s luxury of boundless time and can only spend a couple of weeks in Laos, it’s an idea to focus on one region or cherry-pick sites connected by flights using Lao Airlines. With long distances and less-than-great roads (this is one of the least-developed countries in south-east Asia), river and air transport make sense. Check out also the hop-on, hop-off Stray Travel passes (one week from $389).</p>
            <p>Laos is popular with bicyclists, kayakers and bikers, too. For company, read Christopher Kremmer’s travelogue-cum-mystery-and-history book Bamboo Palace: Discover the Lost Dynasty of Laos, and relish the wry humour in the novels about the adventures of Dr Siri, the national coroner of Laos, and his morgue assistant Dtui by London-born Colin Cotterell.</p>
            <p>The main international gateway to Laos is Luang Prabang, and as no one visits Laos for the first time without soaking up the essence of this city, our two-week itinerary starts here.</p>

            <p>Languid Luang Prabang is Laos’ poster city, built on a finger of land that pokes into the Mekong river in the northern mountains. From here, the royal family ruled the Kingdom of a Million Elephants, founded in 1353. Its exquisite Buddhist temples, Royal palaces and French colonial buildings are now blended with restaurants and roadside cafes, all swagged in bougainvillea. For accommodation, see our top 10 places to stay in Luang Prabang.</p>
            <p>After exploring the historic sights of the Unesco-protected city over a few days (the Royal Palace, Wat Mai, Wat Xieng Thong), get a feel for the living culture with a more practical tour. Learn the craft of bamboo weaving (from US$26) and batik (from US$60) at social enterprise Ock Pop Tok overlooking the Mekong north of town or explore the arts and crafts scene with a three-night tour with Backyard Travels (from US$389, backyardtravel.com). The annual Luang Prabang Film Festival (5-9 December) is worth planning a trip around, as is the autumn Lai Heua Fai fireboat festival.</p>
